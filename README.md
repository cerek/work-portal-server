# Work Portal Server Architecture

![WorkPortal-Server-Architecture](https://wiki.wildsre.com/github/workportal_architecture.png)

**Work Portal Server** comes with an all-in-one software architecture.

**Work Portal Server** was built by [Django REST Framewrok](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) as backend server, which offers the API Service for various clients. All the data will be saved to [MySQL Database](https://www.mysql.com/) in production environment. We also use the [Redis Server](https://redis.io/) as caching server to improve performance.

**Work Portal Server** offers various clients for different scenarios.

- **Web Client Support**: It's a front-end application built with [Work Portal Web](https://github.com/cerek/work-portal-web), and the interface will be used for all login users.
- **Phone App Support**: We will offer the mobile solution in the future.
- **Terminal Support**: [`IT technician only`] It's a command line tool to create/update data quickly.
- **FingerPrint Machine**: Integrate with a self-built fingerprint machine to record the punch-in/out in clocking system.
